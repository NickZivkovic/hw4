1. No, it does not change the variable after the funtion call occurs 

2. Variable b changes after the function call 

3. The distinction lies in the fact that, in Python, integers are immutable and passed by value. 
This means that when altered within a function, the changes do not impact the original value outside the function. 
On the other hand, dictionaries are mutable and passed by reference, signifying that modifications made within the function 
directly affect the original dictionary variable.
