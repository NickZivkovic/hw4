1. The initial benefit is reusability, enabling the programmer to utilize common code and inherit methods and properties from the base class to the child class. 
2. The subsequent advantage is maintainability, facilitating generalized modifications to shared behaviors or attributes across multiple classes simultaneously. 
This reduces the likelihood of introducing errors and ensures consistency throughout the classes.
